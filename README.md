# MovieLens Recommendation
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebooks that explores the MovieLens dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains movie ratings and user information from the MovieLens website. I used multiple approaches to analyze and predict the recommendations.

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset

## Run Locally
Clone the repository and run the corresponding .ipynb files (dataset files should lie within the same folder):
